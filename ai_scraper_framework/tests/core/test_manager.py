# The if __name__ == '__main__': block from core/manager.py will be removed in a subsequent step.
# These tests cover the orchestration logic of ScrapingManager by mocking its dependencies.
# Pillow import for image dimension check in ScrapingManager is also mocked implicitly if not used by mocks.
# If PIL.Image.open is called directly by ScrapingManager, it would need specific mocking too.
# For now, the test assumes that if screenshot_path is not None, it's a valid path to an image file.
# The test for `extract_text_from_image_region` calling with correct bounding box in the success flow
# is simplified as exact image dimensions are hard to mock without deeper PIL/cv2 mocking here.
# The focus is on the call being made if screenshot_path exists.
# The `mock_config_manager_for_manager_tests` is basic; if ScrapingManager itself used more config values,
# this mock would need to be more detailed.
# The patching of components is done where ScrapingManager imports them (i.e., 'ai_scraper_framework.core.manager.ComponentName').
# The `scraping_manager_mocker` returns the manager instance *and* the individual mock instances for convenience.
# This allows tests to both call methods on the manager and assert calls/behavior on the mocks.
# Using `AsyncMock` for `PlaywrightManager` because `get_page_snapshot` and its context manager methods are async.
# Other components are mocked with `MagicMock` as their methods used by `ScrapingManager` are synchronous.
# (Though `ExtractorManager.extract_product_details` could become async later if it involves I/O or heavy CPU).
# The mocks are directly assigned to the manager instance attributes in the fixture. This works if the manager
# uses these attributes (e.g. self.playwright_manager) rather than re-instantiating components per method call.
# Based on `ScrapingManager`'s current `__init__`, it instantiates components and stores them as attributes,
# so this approach of patching constructors and then having the fixture use the resulting mock instances
# (which are now attributes of the manager) is sound.
# The `patch` calls in the fixture ensure that when `ScrapingManager(config=...)` is called,
# it uses our patched constructors, which return our pre-defined mock instances.
# So, `manager.playwright_manager` will indeed be `MockPM_instance`.
# The test `test_scrape_single_url_basic_success_flow` includes mocking `os.remove` and `os.path.exists`
# to verify screenshot cleanup logic.
# The test `test_scrape_single_url_ocr_fails` was refined to ensure `ExtractorManager` is called
# with `text_regions=None` when OCR fails, and that `ocr_extracted_text` is `None` in the saved data.
# This required `ExtractorManager.extract_product_details` to handle `text_regions=None` gracefully.
# (Current stub of `extract_product_details` in `ExtractorManager` does this).
# Added `pytest.mark.asyncio` to all async test functions.
# Corrected patch paths for components to be `ai_scraper_framework.core.manager.ComponentName`.
# Clarified mock instance usage in `scraping_manager_mocker`.
# Corrected assertions for `extract_text_from_image_region` call arguments.
# Corrected assertions for `extract_product_details` call arguments regarding OCR text.
# Ensured `mock_pm.__aenter__` and `mock_pm.__aexit__` are asserted in success flow.
# Note: `Pillow` is used in `ScrapingManager` to get image dimensions for OCR.
# If `Image.open` is called, it would need to be mocked for tests where screenshot_path is not None.
# For `test_scrape_single_url_basic_success_flow`, `Image.open` will be called.
# This needs to be added to the patch context for that test.
# Added patch for `PIL.Image.open` in the success flow test.
# The `from PIL import Image` is now within the test function's patch context.
# The `mock_vm.extract_text_from_image_region.assert_called_once()` is sufficient if we trust its internal bbox logic.
# To be more precise, we could assert the args if we mock `Image.open` to return an image with known dims.
# For now, assume the call itself is the main check.
# Corrected the `patch` calls in `scraping_manager_mocker` to use `return_value` for the instances,
# which is cleaner than assigning to `manager.component = MockComponent_instance` directly after manager init,
# as it ensures the manager's `__init__` itself uses the mocked constructors.Okay, I have created `ai_scraper_framework/tests/core/test_manager.py` with the specified tests and fixtures in the previous turn.

**Recap of `test_manager.py` (created in previous turn):**
-   A `mock_config_manager_for_manager_tests` fixture provides a mock `ConfigurationManager`.
-   A `scraping_manager_mocker` fixture:
    -   Patches the constructors of `PlaywrightManager`, `VisionManager`, `ExtractorManager`, and `FileStorage` within the `ai_scraper_framework.core.manager` module's scope.
    -   These patched constructors return pre-defined mock instances (`AsyncMock` for `PlaywrightManager`, `MagicMock` for others).
    -   Instantiates `ScrapingManager` with the mock config. `ScrapingManager`'s `__init__` will use the patched constructors, so its component attributes will be these mock instances.
    -   Yields the `ScrapingManager` instance and the individual mock instances of its components.
-   Test cases implemented:
    -   `test_scrape_single_url_basic_success_flow`: Mocks successful calls for all components, asserts correct interactions (method calls with expected arguments), and verifies screenshot cleanup (using `patch('os.remove')` and `patch('os.path.exists')`). Also patches `PIL.Image.open` for the image dimension check.
    -   `test_scrape_single_url_playwright_fails`: Mocks `PlaywrightManager.get_page_snapshot` to raise `RendererError`, asserts `TaskManagementError` is raised by the manager, and checks that `save_json` is not called.
    -   `test_scrape_single_url_ocr_fails`: Mocks `VisionManager.extract_text_from_image_region` to raise `ComponentError`. Asserts the workflow continues, data is saved (with OCR text as `None`), and screenshot cleanup occurs.
    -   `test_scrape_single_url_storage_fails`: Mocks `FileStorage.save_json` to raise `StorageError`. Asserts `TaskManagementError` is raised and screenshot cleanup occurs.
    -   `test_scrape_single_url_no_screenshot`: Mocks `PlaywrightManager.get_page_snapshot` to return `None` for `screenshot_path`. Asserts OCR methods are not called, and no screenshot cleanup is attempted.
-   All test functions are marked with `pytest.mark.asyncio`.
-   A fixture mocks the logger in `core.manager` to suppress output.

Now, I will proceed with Step 3: Remove `if __name__ == '__main__':` from `ai_scraper_framework/core/manager.py`.
